        <h2>Love on the Brain: Grey Matter tackles the news and media regarding pornography addiction. A widely debated topic in many fields, pornography addiction presents the two arguments that it can be either healthy or unhealthy for teens and adults. However, because of the nature of pornography and how addictive it can be, outlets have come to the conclusion that addiction can leave those with a damaged brain. On the other hand, evidence regarding addiction has been scarce and undocumented.

        <h2>The topic of pornography addiction is important in the contemporary world because of what it means regarding the power of fake news, false information, and what such can do to harm the sanctity of oneâ€™s well being. With much uncertainty in the world, and with the influence of others across many media outlets, misinformation can prove detrimental to what others believe to be factual or false.</h2>

        <h2>Furthermore, the uncertainty of pornography addiction adds tension to the vulnerability of teens and adults. Although effects of addiction are few reported, the repetition of pornography use has the potential to leave the brain in an unhealthy manner for a long time. The allegorical imagery in Love on the Brain: Grey Matter presents the opinion of news outlets and also others experiences with addiction.</h2>
